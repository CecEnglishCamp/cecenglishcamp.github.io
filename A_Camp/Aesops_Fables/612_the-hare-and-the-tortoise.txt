	The Hare was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. “I have never yet been beaten,” said he, “when I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one here to race with me.”

	The Tortoise said quietly, “I accept your challenge.”

	“That is a good joke,” said the Hare; “I could dance round you all the way.”

	“Keep your boasting till you’ve beaten,” answered the Tortoise. “Shall we race?”

	So a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap. The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race. Then said the Tortoise:

	“Plodding wins the race.”
