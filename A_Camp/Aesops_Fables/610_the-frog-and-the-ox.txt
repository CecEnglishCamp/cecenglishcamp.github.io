	Once a little Frog sat by a big Frog, by the side of a pool. “Oh, father,” said he, “I have just seen the biggest animal in the world; it was as big as a mountain, and it had horns on its head, and it had hoofs divided in two.”

	“Pooh, child,” said the old Frog, “that was only Farmer White’s Ox. He is not so very big. I could easily make myself as big as he.” And he blew, and he blew, and he blew, and swelled himself out.

	“Was he as big as that?” he asked the big Frog.

	“Oh, much bigger,” said the little Frog.

	The old Frog blew, and blew, and blew again, and swelled himself out, more than ever.

	“Was he bigger than that?” he said.

	“Much, much bigger,” said the little Frog.

	“I can make myself as big,” said the old Frog. And once more he blew, and blew, and blew, and swelled himself out,—and he burst!

	Self-conceit leads to self-destruction.
