	One fine day two Crabs came out from their home to take a stroll on the sand. “Child,” said the mother, “you are walking very ungracefully. You should accustom yourself to walking straight forward without twisting from side to side.”

	“Pray, mother,” said the young one, “do but set the example yourself, and I will follow you.”

	Example is the best precept.
