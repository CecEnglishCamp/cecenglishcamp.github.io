	Golden and red trees
	Nod to the soft breeze,
	As it whispers, “Winter is near;”
	And the brown nuts fall
	At the wind’s loud call,
	For this is the Fall of the year.

	Goodbye, sweet flowers!
	Through bright Summer hours
	You have filled our hearts with cheer
	We shall miss you so,
	And yet you must go,
	For this is the Fall of the year.

	Now the days grow cold,
	As the year grows old,
	And the meadows are brown and sere;
	Brave robin redbreast
	Has gone from his nest,
	For this is the Fall of the year.

	I do softly pray
	At the close of day,
	That the little children, so dear,
	May as purely grow
	As the fleecy snow
	That follows the Fall of the year.
