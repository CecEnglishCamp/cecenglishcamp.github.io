	There is a quiet garden,
	From the rude world set apart,
	Where seeds for Christ are growing;
	This is the loving heart.

	The tiny roots are loving thoughts;
	Sweet words, the fragrant flowers
	Which blossom into loving deeds,—
	Ripe fruits for harvest hours.

	Thus in our hearts the seeds of love
	Am growing year by year;
	And we show our love for the Savior,
	By loving His children here.
