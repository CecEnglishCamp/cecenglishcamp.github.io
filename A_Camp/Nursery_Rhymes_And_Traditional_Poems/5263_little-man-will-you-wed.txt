	There was a little man
	And he woo’d a little maid,
	And he said “Little maid will you wed, wed, wed,
	I have little more to say,
	Than will you, yea or nay,
	For the least said soonest men ded, ded, ded.”
	The little maid replied
	(Some say a little sighed)
	“ But what shall we have for to eat, eat, eat,
	Will the love that you are so rich in
	Make a fire in the kitchen,
	Or the little God of Love turn the spit, spit, spit.”
