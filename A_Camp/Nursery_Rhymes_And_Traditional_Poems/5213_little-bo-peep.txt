	Little Bo-peep
	She lost her sheep,
	   And couldn’t tell where to find them.
	“Let them alone
	And they’ll come home,
	   Wagging their tails behind them.”

	Little Bo-peep
	Fell fast asleep
	   And dreamt she heard them bleating,
	But when she awoke,
	She found it a joke,
	   For still they all were fleeting.

	Then up she took
	Her little crook,
	   Determined for to find them.

	She found them indeed,
	But it made her heart bleed,—
	   For they’d left their tails behind them.
