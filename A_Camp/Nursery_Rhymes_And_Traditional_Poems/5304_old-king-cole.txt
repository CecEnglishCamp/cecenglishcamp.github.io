	Old King Cole
	  Was a merry old soul,
	  And a merry old soul was he;

	  He called for his pipe,
	  And he called for his bowl,
	  And he called for his fiddlers three!

	  And every fiddler, he had a fine fiddle,
	  And a very fine fiddle had he.
	  “Twee tweedle dee, tweedle dee,” went the fiddlers.

	  Oh, there’s none so rare
	  As can compare
	  With King Cole and his fiddlers three.
