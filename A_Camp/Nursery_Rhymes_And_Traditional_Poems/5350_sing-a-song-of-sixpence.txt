	Sing a song of sixpence,
	  A pocket full of rye;
	  Four-and-twenty blackbirds
	  Baked in a pie!

	  When the pie was opened
	  The birds began to sing;
	  Was not that a dainty dish
	  To set before the king?

	  The king was in his counting-house,
	  Counting out his money;
	  The queen was in the parlor,
	  Eating bread and honey.

	  The maid was in the garden,
	  Hanging out the clothes;
	  When down came a blackbird
	  And snapped off her nose.
