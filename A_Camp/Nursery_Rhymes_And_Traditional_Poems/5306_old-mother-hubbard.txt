	Old Mother Hubbard
	Went to the cupboard
	   To get her poor dog a bone;
	But when she got there,
	The cupboard was bare,
	   And so the poor dog had none.

	She went to the baker’s
	   To buy him some bread;
	And when she came back,
	   The poor dog was dead.

	She went to the joiner’s
	   To buy him a coffin;
	And when she came back,
	   The doggy was laughin’.

	She went to the butcher’s
	   To buy him some tripe;
	And when she came back,
	   He was smoking his pipe.

	She went to the hatter’s
	   To buy him a hat;
	And when she came back,
	   He was feeding the cat.

	She went to the barber’s
	   To buy him a wig;
	And when she came back,
	   He was dancing a jig.

	She went to the tailor’s
	   To buy him a coat;
	And when she came back,
	   He was riding a goat.

	She went to the cobbler’s
	   To buy him some shoes;
	And when she came back,
	   He was reading the news.
