	       I lived first in a little house,
	           And lived there very well;
	         I thought the world was small and round,
	           And made of pale blue shell.

	         I lived next in a little nest,
	           Nor needed any other;
	         I thought the world was made of straw,
	           And brooded by my mother.

	         One day I fluttered from the nest
	           To see what I could find.
	         I said, “The world is made of leaves;
	           I have been very blind.”

	         At length I flew beyond the tree,
	           Quite fit for grown-up labours.
	         I don’t know how the world is  made,
	           And neither do my neighbours!
