	Little Robin Redbreast sat upon a tree,
	Up went Pussy-cat, and down went he;
	Down came Pussy-cat, and away Robin ran;
	Says little Robin Redbreast, “Catch me if you can.”
	Little Robin Redbreast flew upon a wall,
	Pussy-cat jumped after him, and almost got a fall;
	Little Robin chirp’d and sang, and what did Kitty say?
	Pussy-cat said “Mew,” and Robin flew away.
