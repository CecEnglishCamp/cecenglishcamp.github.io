	The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
	      All on a summer’s day;
	The knave of Hearts, he stole the tarts,
	      And took them clean away.

	  The King of Hearts
	  Called for the tarts,
	  And beat the Knave full sore;
	  The Knave of Hearts
	  Brought back the tarts,
	  And vowed he’d steal no more.
