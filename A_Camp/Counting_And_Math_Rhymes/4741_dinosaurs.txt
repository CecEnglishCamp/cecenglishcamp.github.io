	Five enormous dinosaurs

	Letting out a roar—

	One went away, and

	Then there were four.

	Four enormous dinosaurs

	Crashing down a tree—

	One went away, and

	Then there were three.

	Three enormous dinosaurs

	Eating tiger stew—

	One went away, and

	Then there were two.

	Two enormous dinosaurs

	Trying to run—

	One ran away, and

	Then there was one.

	One enormous dinosaur,

	Afraid to be a hero—

	He went away, and

	Then there was zero.
