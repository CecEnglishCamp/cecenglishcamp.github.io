	Five little blue birds, hopping by my door
	One went to build a nest, and then there were four

	Four little blue birds singing lustily
	One got out of tune, and then there were three

	Three little blue birds, and what should one do,
	But go in search of dinner, leaving only two.

	Two little blue birds singing for fun
	One flew away, and then there was one.

	One little blue bird sitting in the sun
	He took a little nap, and then there was none.
