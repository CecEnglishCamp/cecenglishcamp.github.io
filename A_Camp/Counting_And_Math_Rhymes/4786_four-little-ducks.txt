	Four little ducks that I once knew,
	Fat ducks, skinny ducks, they were, too.
	But one little duck with a feather on her back,
	She ruled the others with a quack! quack! quack!
	Down to the river they all would go,
	1, 2, 3, 4, all in a row.
	But one little duck with a feather on her back,
	She ruled the others with a quack! quack! quack!
