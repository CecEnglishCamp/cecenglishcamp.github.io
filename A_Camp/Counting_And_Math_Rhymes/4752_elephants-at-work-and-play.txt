	As 5 little elephants marched through the grass
	They decided to stop and have a music class,
	The first blew his trumpet and announced he’d be teacher.
	The next gave a call of the wild jungle animal
	The third and fourth elephants trumpeted a song,
	But the last little elephant just followed along,
	Then he left the others as he didn’t care to play,
	And he carried tree logs the rest of the day.
