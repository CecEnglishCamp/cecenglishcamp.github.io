	Pretty little goldfish
	Never can talk.
	All it does is wiggle
	When it tries to walk.

	One, two, three, four, five,
	I caught a fish alive.
	Six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
	I let him go again!

	Why did I let him go?
	Because he bit my finger so.
	Which finger did he bite?
	The little one on the right.
