	One and one are two,

	One for me and one for you.

	Two and two are four,

	That’s a couple more.

	Three and three are six,

	Straight and crooked sticks.

	Four and four are eight,

	Seagulls on a gate.

	Five and five are ten,

	Tall and short men.

	Six and six are twelve,

	Puppies dig and delve.

	Seven and seven are fourteen,

	Naughty ghosts are haunting.

	Eight and eight are sixteen,

	Mother’s busy mixing.

	Nine and nine are eighteen,

	Passengers are waiting.

	Ten and ten are twenty,

	We have all got plenty.
