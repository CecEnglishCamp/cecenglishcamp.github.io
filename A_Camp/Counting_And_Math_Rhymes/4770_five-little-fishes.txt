	Five little fishes swimming in a pool.

	The first one said,

	The pool is cool.

	The second one said,

	The pool is deep.

	The third one said,

	I want to sleep.

	The fourth one said,

	Let’s dive and dip.

	The fifth one said.

	I spy a ship.

	The boat comes, and a line goes kerplash.

	Away the five little fishies dash!
