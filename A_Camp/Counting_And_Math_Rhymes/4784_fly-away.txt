	Ten little sparrows cheeping at the door,

	Six flew away and then there were four.

	Ten big magpies sitting in a tree,

	Seven flew away and then there were three.

	Ten shiny mynah birds sitting on the line,

	One flew away and that left nine.

	Ten white seagulls sitting in the sun,

	Nine flew away and that left one.
