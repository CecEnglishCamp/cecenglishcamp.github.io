	Five little chickadees, sitting by a door
	One flew away, and then there were four
	Chickadees, chickadees, happy and gay,
	Chickadees, chickadees, fly away.

	Four little chickadees, sitting in a tree
	One flew away, and then there were three.
	Chickadees, chickadees, happy and gay,
	Chickadees, chickadees, fly away.

	Three little chickadees, looking at you
	One flew away, and then there were two.
	Chickadees, chickadees, happy and gay,
	Chickadees, chickadees, fly away.

	Two little chickadees, sitting in the sun
	One flew away, and then there was one.
	Chickadees, chickadees, happy and gay,
	Chickadees, chickadees, fly away.

	One little chickadee, sitting all alone
	That one flew away, and then there was none.
	Chickadees, chickadees, happy and gay,
	Chickadees, chickadees, fly away.
