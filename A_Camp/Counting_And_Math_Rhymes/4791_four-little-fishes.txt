	Four little fishes swimming out to sea,

	One met a shark!...

	And then there were three.

	Three little fishes wondering what to do,

	One hid in a great big shell...

	And then there were two.

	Two little fishes looking for some fun,

	One chased after a wave...

	And that left one.

	One little fish with all his friends gone,

	Went back home to find his mum...

	And that left none!
