	Late lies the wintry sun a-bed,
	A frosty, fiery sleepy-head;
	Blinks but an hour or two; and then,
	A blood-red orange, sets again.

	Before the stars have left the skies,
	At morning in the dark I rise;
	And shivering in my nakedness,
	By the cold candle, bathe and dress.

	Close by the jolly fire I sit
	To warm my frozen bones a bit;
	Or with a reindeer-sled, explore
	The colder countries round the door.

	When to go out, my nurse doth wrap
	Me in my comforter and cap;
	The cold wind burns my face, and blows
	Its frosty pepper up my nose.

	Black are my steps on silver sod;
	Thick blows my frosty breath abroad;
	And tree and house, and hill and lake,
	Are frosted like a wedding cake.
