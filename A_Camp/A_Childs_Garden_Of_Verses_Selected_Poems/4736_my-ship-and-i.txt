	O it’s I that am the captain of a tidy little ship,
	      Of a ship that goes a sailing on the pond;
	And my ship it keeps a-turning all around and all about;
	But when I’m a little older, I shall find the secret out
	      How to send my vessel sailing on beyond.

	For I mean to grow as little as the dolly at the helm,
	      And the dolly I intend to come alive;
	And with him beside to help me, it’s a-sailing I shall go,
	It’s a-sailing on the water, when the jolly breezes blow
	      And the vessel goes a divie-divie-dive.

	O it’s then you’ll see me sailing through the rushes and the reeds,
	      And you’ll hear the water singing at the prow;
	For beside the dolly sailor, I’m to voyage and explore,
	To land upon the island where no dolly was before,
	      And to fire the penny cannon in the bow.
