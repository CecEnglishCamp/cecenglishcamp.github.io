	The friendly cow all red and white,
	      I love with all my heart:
	She gives me cream with all her might,
	      To eat with apple-tart.

	She wanders lowing here and there,
	      And yet she cannot stray,
	All in the pleasant open air,
	      The pleasant light of day;

	And blown by all the winds that pass
	      And wet with all the showers,
	She walks among the meadow grass
	      And eats the meadow flowers.
