	The coach is at the door at last;
	The eager children, mounting fast
	And kissing hands, in chorus sing:
	Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!

	To house and garden, field and lawn,
	The meadow-gates we swang upon,
	To pump and stable, tree and swing,
	Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!

	And fare you well for evermore,
	O ladder at the hayloft door,
	O hayloft where the cobwebs cling,
	Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!

	Crack goes the whip, and off we go;
	The trees and houses smaller grow;
	Last, round the woody turn we sing:
	Good-bye, good-bye, to everything!
