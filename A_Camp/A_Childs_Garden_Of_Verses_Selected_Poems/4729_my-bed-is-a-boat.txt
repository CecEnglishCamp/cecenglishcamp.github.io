	My bed is like a little boat;
	      Nurse helps me in when I embark;
	She girds me in my sailor’s coat
	      And starts me in the dark.

	At night I go on board and say
	      Good-night to all my friends on shore;
	I shut my eyes and sail away
	      And see and hear no more.

	And sometimes things to bed I take,
	      As prudent sailors have to do;
	Perhaps a slice of wedding-cake,
	      Perhaps a toy or two.

	All night across the dark we steer;
	      But when the day returns at last,
	Safe in my room beside the pier,
	      I find my vessel fast.
