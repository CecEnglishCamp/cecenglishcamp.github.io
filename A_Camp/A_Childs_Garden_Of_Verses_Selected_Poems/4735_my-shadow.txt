	I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me,
	And what can be the use of him is more than I can see.
	He is very, very like me from the heels up to the head;
	And I see him jump before me, when I jump into my bed.

	The funniest thing about him is the way he likes to grow—
	Not at all like proper children, which is always very slow;
	For he sometimes shoots up taller like an india-rubber ball,
	And he sometimes goes so little that there’s none of him at all.

	He hasn’t got a notion of how children ought to play,
	And can only make a fool of me in every sort of way.
	He stays so close behind me, he’s a coward you can see;
	I’d think shame to stick to nursie as that shadow sticks to me!

	One morning, very early, before the sun was up,
	I rose and found the shining dew on every buttercup;
	But my lazy little shadow, like an arrant sleepy-head,
	Had stayed at home behind me and was fast asleep in bed.
