	Great is the sun, and wide he goes
	Through empty heaven with repose;
	And in the blue and glowing days
	More thick than rain he showers his rays.

	Though closer still the blinds we pull
	To keep the shady parlour cool,
	Yet he will find a chink or two
	To slip his golden fingers through.

	The dusty attic spider-clad
	He, through the keyhole, maketh glad;
	And through the broken edge of tiles
	Into the laddered hay-loft smiles.

	Meantime his golden face around
	He bares to all the garden ground,
	And sheds a warm and glittering look
	Among the ivy’s inmost nook.

	Above the hills, along the blue,
	Round the bright air with footing true,
	To please the child, to paint the rose,
	The gardener of the World, he goes.
