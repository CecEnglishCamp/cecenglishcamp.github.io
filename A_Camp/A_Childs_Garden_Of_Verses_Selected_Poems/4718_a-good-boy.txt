	I woke before the morning, I was happy all the day,
	I never said an ugly word, but smiled and stuck to play.

	And now at last the sun is going down behind the wood,
	And I am very happy, for I know that I’ve been good.

	My bed is waiting cool and fresh, with linen smooth and fair,
	And I must be off to sleepsin-by, and not forget my prayer.

	I know that, till to-morrow I shall see the sun arise,
	No ugly dream shall fright my mind, no ugly sight my eyes.

	But slumber hold me tightly till I waken in the dawn,
	And hear the thrushes singing in the lilacs round the lawn.
