	Summer fading, winter comes—
	Frosty mornings, tingling thumbs,
	Window robins, winter rooks,
	And the picture story-books.

	Water now is turned to stone
	Nurse and I can walk upon;
	Still we find the flowing brooks
	In the picture story-books.

	All the pretty things put by,
	Wait upon the children’s eye,
	Sheep and shepherds, trees and crooks,
	In the picture story-books.

	We may see how all things are
	Seas and cities, near and far,
	And the flying fairies’ looks,
	In the picture story-books.

	How am I to sing your praise,
	Happy chimney-corner days,
	Sitting safe in nursery nooks,
	Reading picture story-books?
