	Down by a shining water well
	I found a very little dell,
	      No higher than my head.
	The heather and the gorse about
	In summer bloom were coming out,
	      Some yellow and some red.

	I called the little pool a sea;
	The little hills were big to me;
	      For I am very small.
	I made a boat, I made a town,
	I searched the caverns up and down,
	      And named them one and all.

	And all about was mine, I said,
	The little sparrows overhead,
	      The little minnows too.
	This was the world and I was king;
	For me the bees came by to sing,
	      For me the swallows flew.

	I played there were no deeper seas,
	Nor any wider plains than these,
	      Nor other kings than me.
	At last I heard my mother call
	Out from the house at evenfall,
	      To call me home to tea.

	And I must rise and leave my dell,
	And leave my dimpled water well,
	      And leave my heather blooms.
	Alas! and as my home I neared,
	How very big my nurse appeared.
	      How great and cool the rooms!
