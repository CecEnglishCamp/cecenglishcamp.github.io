	How do you like to go up in a swing,
	      Up in the air so blue?
	Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing
	      Ever a child can do!

	Up in the air and over the wall,
	      Till I can see so wide,
	River and trees and cattle and all
	      Over the countryside—

	Till I look down on the garden green,
	      Down on the roof so brown—
	Up in the air I go flying again,
	      Up in the air and down!
