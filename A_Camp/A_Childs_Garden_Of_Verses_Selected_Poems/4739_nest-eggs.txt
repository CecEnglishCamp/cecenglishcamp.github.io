	Birds all the sunny day
	      Flutter and quarrel
	Here in the arbour-like
	      Tent of the laurel.

	Here in the fork
	      The brown nest is seated;
	Four little blue eggs
	      The mother keeps heated.

	While we stand watching her
	      Staring like gabies,
	Safe in each egg are the
	      Bird’s little babies.

	Soon the frail eggs they shall
	      Chip, and upspringing
	Make all the April woods
	      Merry with singing.

	Younger than we are,
	      O children, and frailer,
	Soon in the blue air they’ll be,
	      Singer and sailor.

	We, so much older,
	      Taller and stronger,
	We shall look down on the
	      Birdies no longer.

	They shall go flying
	      With musical speeches
	High overhead in the
	      Tops of the beeches.

	In spite of our wisdom
	      And sensible talking,
	We on our feet must go
	      Plodding and walking.
