	In the other gardens
	      And all up the vale,
	From the autumn bonfires
	      See the smoke trail!

	Pleasant summer over
	      And all the summer flowers,
	The red fire blazes,
	      The grey smoke towers.

	Sing a song of seasons!
	      Something bright in all!
	Flowers in the summer,
	      Fires in the fall!
