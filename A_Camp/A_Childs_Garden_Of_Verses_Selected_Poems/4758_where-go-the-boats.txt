	Dark brown is the river,
	      Golden is the sand.
	It flows along for ever,
	      With trees on either hand.

	Green leaves a-floating,
	      Castles of the foam,
	Boats of mine a-boating—
	      Where will all come home?

	On goes the river
	      And out past the mill,
	Away down the valley,
	      Away down the hill.

	Away down the river,
	      A hundred miles or more,
	Other little children
	      Shall bring my boats ashore.
