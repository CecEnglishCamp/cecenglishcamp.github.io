	In winter I get up at night
	And dress by yellow candle-light.
	In summer quite the other way,
	I have to go to bed by day.

	I have to go to bed and see
	The birds still hopping on the tree,
	Or hear the grown-up people’s feet
	Still going past me in the street.

	And does it not seem hard to you,
	When all the sky is clear and blue,
	And I should like so much to play,
	To have to go to bed by day?
