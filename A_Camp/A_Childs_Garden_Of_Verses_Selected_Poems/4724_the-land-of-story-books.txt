	At evening when the lamp is lit,
	Around the fire my parents sit;
	They sit at home and talk and sing,
	And do not play at anything.

	Now, with my little gun, I crawl
	All in the dark along the wall,
	And follow round the forest track
	Away behind the sofa back.

	There, in the night, where none can spy,
	All in my hunter’s camp I lie,
	And play at books that I have read
	Till it is time to go to bed.

	These are the hills, these are the woods,
	These are my starry solitudes;
	And there the river by whose brink
	The roaring lions come to drink.

	I see the others far away
	As if in firelit camp they lay,
	And I, like to an Indian scout,
	Around their party prowled about.

	So when my nurse comes in for me,
	Home I return across the sea,
	And go to bed with backward looks
	At my dear land of Story-books.
