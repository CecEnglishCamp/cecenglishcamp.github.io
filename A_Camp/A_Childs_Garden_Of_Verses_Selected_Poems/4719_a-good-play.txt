	We built a ship upon the stairs
	All made of the back-bedroom chairs,
	And filled it full of sofa pillows
	To go a-sailing on the billows.

	We took a saw and several nails,
	And water in the nursery pails;
	And Tom said, “Let us also take
	An apple and a slice of cake;”—
	Which was enough for Tom and me
	To go a-sailing on, till tea.

	We sailed along for days and days,
	And had the very best of plays;
	But Tom fell out and hurt his knee,
	So there was no one left but me.
