	Up into the cherry tree
	Who should climb but little me?
	I held the trunk with both my hands
	And looked abroad in foreign lands.

	I saw the next door garden lie,
	Adorned with flowers, before my eye,
	And many pleasant places more
	That I had never seen before.

	I saw the dimpling river pass
	And be the sky’s blue looking-glass;
	The dusty roads go up and down
	With people tramping in to town.

	If I could find a higher tree
	Farther and farther I should see,
	To where the grown-up river slips
	Into the sea among the ships,

	To where the roads on either hand
	Lead onward into fairy land,
	Where all the children dine at five,
	And all the playthings come alive.
