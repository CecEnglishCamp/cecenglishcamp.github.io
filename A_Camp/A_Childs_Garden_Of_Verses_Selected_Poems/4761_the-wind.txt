	I saw you toss the kites on high
	And blow the birds about the sky;
	And all around I heard you pass,
	Like ladies’ skirts across the grass—
	      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
	      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

	I saw the different things you did,
	But always you yourself you hid.
	I felt you push, I heard you call,
	I could not see yourself at all—
	      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
	      O wind, that sings so loud a song!

	O you that are so strong and cold,
	O blower, are you young or old?
	Are you a beast of field and tree,
	Or just a stronger child than me?
	      O wind, a-blowing all day long,
	      O wind, that sings so loud a song!
