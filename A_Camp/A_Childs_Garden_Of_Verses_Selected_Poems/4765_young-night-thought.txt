	All night long and every night,
	When my mama puts out the light,
	I see the people marching by,
	As plain as day before my eye.

	Armies and emperor and kings,
	All carrying different kinds of things,
	And marching in so grand a way,
	You never saw the like by day.

	So fine a show was never seen
	At the great circus on the green;
	For every kind of beast and man
	Is marching in that caravan.

	As first they move a little slow,
	But still the faster on they go,
	And still beside me close I keep
	Until we reach the town of Sleep.
