	When the golden day is done,
	      Through the closing portal,
	Child and garden, flower and sun,
	      Vanish all things mortal.

	As the building shadows fall
	      As the rays diminish,
	Under evening’s cloak they all
	      Roll away and vanish.

	Garden darkened, daisy shut,
	      Child in bed, they slumber—
	Glow-worm in the hallway rut,
	      Mice among the lumber.

	In the darkness houses shine,
	      Parents move the candles;
	Till on all the night divine
	      Turns the bedroom handles.

	Till at last the day begins
	      In the east a-breaking,
	In the hedges and the whins
	      Sleeping birds a-waking.

	In the darkness shapes of things,
	      Houses, trees and hedges,
	Clearer grow; and sparrow’s wings
	      Beat on window ledges.

	These shall wake the yawning maid;
	      She the door shall open—
	Finding dew on garden glade
	      And the morning broken.

	There my garden grows again
	      Green and rosy painted,
	As at eve behind the pane
	      From my eyes it fainted.

	Just as it was shut away,
	      Toy-like, in the even,
	Here I see it glow with day
	      Under glowing heaven.

	Every path and every plot,
	      Every blush of roses,
	Every blue forget-me-not
	      Where the dew reposes,

	“Up!” they cry, “the day is come
	      On the smiling valleys:
	We have beat the morning drum;
	      Playmate, join your allies!”
