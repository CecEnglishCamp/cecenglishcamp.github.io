  <h2>A2 Grammar Lesson – 과거 시제 비교</h2>
  
  <div class="section concept">
    <h3>기본 개념 (Concept)</h3>
    <p><strong>Past Simple</strong>은 과거의 완료된 행동이나 사건을 표현합니다. <strong>Past Continuous</strong>는 과거의 특정 시점에 진행 중이던 행동을 나타냅니다.</p>
    
    <div class="tense-comparison">
      <div class="tense-card simple">
        <h4>PAST SIMPLE</h4>
        <p><strong>완료된 행동</strong></p>
        <p>시작과 끝이 명확한 과거 사건</p>
        <p>주어 + 과거형 동사</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tense-card continuous">
        <h4>PAST CONTINUOUS</h4>

    <div class="timeline">
      <p><strong>시간선에서 이해하기:</strong></p>
      <p>Past Continuous: ────●────●───── (진행 중)</p>
      <p>Past Simple: ────────▲───────── (완료된 순간)</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>예시 비교:</p>
    <div class="example">I watched a movie last night. (Past Simple – 완료된 행동)</div>
    <div class="example">I was watching a movie when you called. (Past Continuous – 진행 중이던 행동)</div>
