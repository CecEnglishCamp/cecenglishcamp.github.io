# 📘 Season 2, Episode 2 – 심연의 불빛

> 태백, 2025년 봄.
> 

장성탄광 지하 340m.

철제 구조물과 케이블이 얽힌 데이터센터 현장은

봄이 와도 여전히 서늘한 공기를 머금고 있었다.

*지직—*

황지연못의 지하수(7,000톤, 9.8℃)가 냉각 파이프를 타고 흐르며

서버를 위한 심장을 준비했다.

미소는 보호모를 쓴 채, 천천히 갱도 안으로 들어섰다.

손에는 여전히 아버지의 설계도가 들려 있었다.

> “아빠, 이제 진짜 시작이야.”
> 

---

## 시공과 기술

태백의 인구는 3.2만 명.

보조금 삭감 위기는 벗어났지만, 아직 완전한 신뢰는 남지 않았다.

로보가 홀로그램을 띄웠다.

> “냉각 시스템 60% 완료.
> 
> 
> 보안 시스템 테스트 대기.
> 
> 전자파 차단율 98%.
> 
> 난방비 절감 예상치 40%.”
> 

렌즈는 서버 모듈 위를 천천히 훑었고,

점프는 벽을 타고 천장 보안 구역을 순찰했다.

*슈웅—!*

그의 눈이 깜빡였다. 💙

> “외부 침입 없음.”
> 

미소는 조용히 말했다.

> “삼성SDS의 믿음 덕분이야.”
> 

---

## 정치의 열기

태백시청 회의실.

중앙정부는 원전 건설과 데이터센터 전력 연계를 공식 발표했다.

시장 김태영이 연단에 섰다.

> “태백은 국가 인프라의 심장이 될 수 있습니다.”
> 

그러나 박성민 의원이 일어났다.

> “원전은 위험합니다. 지진, 누출, 비용… 지금도 반대 많아요.”
> 

미소는 천천히 입을 열었다.

> “지하 340m는 EMP와 자연 재해에 강해요.
> 
> 
> 폐열은 난방으로, 데이터센터는 일자리로 바뀌죠.
> 
> 고용 15% 상승, 난방비는 절반 이하.”
> 

로보가 시뮬레이션을 투사했다.

골목마다 피어오르는 증기,

포근한 집 안, 웃는 얼굴들.

> “핀란드 Pyhäsalmi는 지하 1,430m에서 성공했어요.
> 
> 
> 태백은 조건이 더 나아요.”
>

## 주민 회의

하지만 주민 회의는 냉랭했다.

김옥자 씨가 손을 들었다.

> “10년 전 대기업도 멋진 말 했지.
> 
> 
> 그리고… 우리 다 버렸잖아.”
> 

젊은 부모가 물었다.

> “폐교, 다시 열 수 있어요?”
> 

미소는 낡은 공책을 떠올렸다.

‘**영원한 친구!**’

그 글씨체는 너무 작고 다정했다.

> “아이들, 돌아올 거예요.
> 
> 
> 이번엔 우리가 먼저 준비했으니까요.”
> 

삼성SDS는 절감된 2,000억 원을 복지에 투입했다.

GTX 연결, 의료시설, 주택, 교사 재배치.

시장도 조용히 고개를 끄덕였다.

> “교도소는 단기. 데이터센터는 20년짜리 미래다.”
> 

---

## 이상 신호

지하로 내려온 미소는 냉각 시스템을 점검했다.

*지직—*

순간, 시스템이 미세하게 흔들렸다.

로보가 분석했다.

> “전력 변동 감지.
> 
> 
> 원전 연계 불안정 추정.”
> 

점프가 반사적으로 터널 끝으로 뛰었다.

*텅!*

그곳, 어둠 속 단자 위에 빛나는 코드.

> J-28
> 

로보가 경고했다.

> “T.O.B.I. 신호 재탐지.
> 
> 
> 이안 활동 가능성.”
> 

미소는 조각을 쥐었다.

손에 닿은 금속이 따뜻했다.

*지직—*

큐브가 깜빡이며 빛났다.

> “이안… 너, 지금 뭐 노리는 거야?”
> 

---

## 설명회와 결심

시청 광장.

‘**미래학교 재건 설명회**’ 현수막 아래, 아이들이 점프를 따라 달렸다.

*툭!*

점프가 조심스레 조각을 보여주자, 아이들의 눈이 커졌다.

호기심, 환호, 웃음.

김옥자 씨는 조용히 눈가를 닦았다.

> “애들이… 정말 돌아오겠구나…”
> 

미소는 입을 다물었다가 천천히 말했다.

> “태백은 심연에서… 빛나게 될 거예요.”
> 

---

황지연못의 물소리가 터널 벽을 타고 울렸다.

점프의 눈이 다시 한번 천천히 깜빡였다. 💙💙

Robo, a robot, showed a picture. “The mine is safe. It can cool machines and heat houses,” Robo said. Jump, another robot, climbed the walls. “All clear!” Jump said. Miso smiled. “A big company trusts us,” she said. In the city hall, the mayor said, “Taebaek can be important!” A man said, “The power plant is dangerous.” Miso said, “The mine is strong.

## 📖 Reading: Story (B2 English Version)

**Beacons in the Abyss**

In Taebaek’s cool spring of 2025, Miso walked the cold tunnels of Jangseong Mine, 340 meters underground. The air carried the sharp tang of groundwater, buzzing as Hwangjeecheon’s flow (7,000 tons daily, 9.8°C) ran through cooling pipes, powering the data center’s heart. Hardhat on, Miso gripped her father’s faded blueprint. “It’s really happening, Dad,” she whispered. Taebaek, with 32,000 residents, had dodged funding cuts, but trust was still shaky. Robo’s hologram glowed: “Cooling system 60% done, shielding at 98%, heating costs down 40%.” Its lenses swept over server setups. Jump climbed the walls, on high alert, blue eyes sharp. “All clear,” it signaled. Miso murmured, “Samsung SDS believed in us.”

In city hall, Mayor Kim Taeyoung spoke up. “Taebaek can be a national hub,” he said, voice strong. Councilor Park Seongmin pushed back. “The nuclear plant’s a risk—quakes, leaks, expenses.” Miso stood, steady. “The mine’s 340 meters deep—it can handle EMPs and disasters. Its heat warms homes, its data center brings jobs—15% more jobs, heating costs cut in half.” Robo’s hologram showed steam rising from warm homes, happy faces. “Finland’s Pyhäsalmi works at 1,430 meters; Taebaek’s setup is better,” she said.

At the community meeting, doubts lingered. Elder Kim Ok-ja spoke up. “Ten years ago, big promises left us with nothing,” she said. A young mom asked, “Will the school stay open?” Miso thought of a child’s scrawl—“Forever friends!”—and answered, “The kids will be back; we’re ready this time.” Samsung SDS poured 200 billion won of savings into homes, clinics, and GTX lines. The mayor nodded. “A prison’s a quick fix; this is a 20-year plan.”

A tremor shook the mine. Robo’s voice cut through: “Power fluctuation—nuclear grid’s unstable.” Jump raced to the tunnel’s end, digging up a glowing code: “J-28.” Robo warned, “T.O.B.I. signal—Ian’s likely behind it.” Miso held the fragment, its warmth unsettling. “Ian, what’re you up to?” she whispered. At the school rally, Jump’s flips lit up the crowd. Kim Ok-ja, eyes wet, murmured, “The kids are back.” Miso stared at the square’s banner: “Taebaek Data Hub.” She vowed, “Taebaek will shine from its depths.” The Hwangjeecheon River’s rhythm echoed, glowing with hope.
