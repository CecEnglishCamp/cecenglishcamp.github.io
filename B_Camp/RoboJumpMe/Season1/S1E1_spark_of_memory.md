# Season 1, Episode 1

# 📘 Episode 1 – 마을 아래, 빛이 살아 있다태백, 2025년 겨울.

황지천은 얼어붙지 않은 물소리를 내며 흐르고 있었다. 하늘에서 부는 바람은 얇은 유리조각처럼 미소의 뺨을 스쳤다.

폐교된 장성초 앞에 멈춰선 그녀의 손에는 오래된 철제 상자가 들려 있었다. 잠금쇠엔 녹이 가득 껴 있었고, 열쇠는 오래전에 잃어버렸다.

미소는 한쪽 무릎을 꿇고, 상자를 들여다봤다. 손톱으로 눌러 열린 뚜껑 안에는 바랜 종이 뭉치가 차분히 들어 있었다.

**‘T.O.B.I. 프로젝트 – 장성탄광 열 회수 시스템’**

붓펜으로 써내려간 아버지의 필체. 낯설지만, 동시에 아득히 익숙한 곡선들.

> “이걸로… 뭘 하려고 했던 거야?”
> 

마치 종이 안쪽에서 대답이 새어 나올 것만 같았다.

---

**“출입금지”**

녹슨 철문에 붙은 팻말은 낡아 거의 떨어질 지경이었다.

하지만 미소는 밀었다. 문은 금속을 긁는 소리를 내며 열렸다. 어둠이, 서늘하고 낯선 공기가 밀려왔다.

그 순간, *텅!* 금속 위로 날렵한 그림자가 튀어 올랐다.

네 개의 다리로 착지한 작은 로봇. 눈처럼 반짝이는 두 개의 파란 렌즈.

미소는 무의식적으로 뒤로 물러났다.

> “…너 뭐야?”
> 

로봇은 고개를 살짝 기울이더니 눈을 두 번 깜빡였다.

홀로그램이 공중에 떠올랐다.

**[T.O.B.I. UNIT-2 / JUMP]**

로봇은 돌아서서 지하로 향하는 철제 통로를 향해 뛰기 시작했다. 미소는 몇 걸음 망설이다가, 결국 따라갔다.

---

리프트는 덜컹이며 천천히 내려갔다.

- `80m, -180m, -400m.`

지하 400m, 습기 찬 공기.

페인트 벗겨진 철벽, 굴착기 잔해, 지하수의 똑똑 떨어지는 소리. 미소는 숨을 들이마셨다. 석탄이 남긴 먼지와 기계의 기름 냄새가 뒤섞인, 오래된 탄광의 냄새.

점프는 한 벽면으로 뛰어올라 큐브 같은 단말기를 작동시켰다.

*우우웅—*

미세한 진동과 함께 벽 하나가 열렸다. 어둠 속에서, 작은 기계음과 함께 **로보**가 움직이기 시작했다.

금속성의 목소리, 그러나 어딘가 따뜻한 톤.

> “T.O.B.I. UNIT-1: ROBO. 관리자 모드. 대기 일수: 3,672일.”
> 
> 
> “상태 점검 중… 장성탄광 지하 구조 분석… 물리적 조건 적합.”
> 
> “지하수 온도: 9.8도. 하루 유출량: 5,000톤. 냉각 효율 92.4%.”
> 

미소는 자신도 모르게 숨을 들이켰다.

> “…이거, 서버… 데이터센터 얘기야?”
> 

로보는 정면을 향한 채 대답했다.

> “정확합니다. 에스토니아, 핀란드, 노르웨이 사례 기반. 폐광은 냉각에 최적화된 자산. 열 회수 가능성 73%. 마을 내 난방 전환 효율 86%.”
> 

점프는 로보의 곁에서 배관을 밀어내며 좁은 공간을 정리했다.

미소는 설계도의 모서리에 적힌 이름을 다시 떠올렸다. **“아버지의 손글씨.”**

> “…이걸 아빠가?”
> 

---

그때, 진동이 땅을 울렸다. 로보의 눈이 빠르게 깜빡였다.

> “경고. 외부 신호 감지. T.O.B.I. 외부 통신 규약 위반. 프로토콜 불일치.”
> 

점프는 벽을 기어올랐다. 기민한 시선으로 어둠을 스캔하던 그가 휙 고개를 돌렸다.

> “무언가 있었어. 사람은 아니야.”
> 

로보의 눈빛이 푸르게 멈췄다.

> “어둠 속 무언가. 확인되지 않은 잔여 시스템 혹은… 이안?”
> 

미소는 가슴을 움켜쥐었다.

차가운 공기가 폐를 흔들었지만, 그보다 더한 전율이 등줄기를 타고 흐르고 있었다.

> “이건 그냥 폐광이 아니야…”
> 

미소는 로보와 점프를 바라보았다. 자신도 모르게 말이 흘러나왔다.

> “우리가 이 마을을 깨울 거야. 여길 다시 살려낼 거야. 시작은 여기야.”
> 

---

**[NEXT MISSION: UNIT 1 & 2 - REBOOT PROTOCOL]**

그 순간, 위에서 황지천의 물소리가 울려 퍼졌다.

그 소리는 어둠 속에서, 마치 **심장처럼** 또각 또각, 뛰고 있었다.

**Light Lives Under the Village**

In Taebaek, winter 2025, Miso stands in front of an empty school. The Hwangjeecheon River flows nearby with a soft sound. A cold wind touches her face. She holds her dad’s rusty metal box tightly. She opens it and finds old papers. They are plans for a “T.O.B.I. Project” about a mine’s heat system. Miso is curious and walks to the old mine. The gate is rusty with a “No Entry” sign. She pushes it open, and cold, strange air comes out. A robot appears. Its name is Jump. It is fast with bright blue eyes. Jump takes Miso deep into the mine, 400 meters down. The air is cold and wet. Old machines and pipes are everywhere. She smells coal dust and oil. Another robot, Robo, wakes up. Robo says, “I am T.O.B.I. UNIT-1. This mine can be a data center. It can cool machines and heat the village.” Miso is excited. “This can save our village!” she says. Then, the ground shakes. Robo warns, “There is a danger signal!” Jump looks into the dark and says, “Something is there, not a person.” Miso’s heart beats fast. “This is not just a mine,” she says.

## 📖 Reading: Story (B2 English Version)

**Light Lives Beneath the Village**

In Taebaek’s winter of 2025, Miso stands before the abandoned Jangseong Elementary School. The Hwangjeecheon River murmurs nearby. A sharp breeze brushes her face. She clutches her father’s rusty metal box. She kneels and opens it, revealing faded papers titled “T.O.B.I. Project: Jangseong Mine Heat Recovery System.” Her father’s handwriting feels familiar yet distant. “What were you searching for, Dad?” she whispers.

Curious, Miso heads to the old mine. Its gate, marked “No Entry,” is falling apart. She pushes it open, and cold, strange air rushes out. Suddenly, a quick robot, Jump, leaps onto a beam. Its blue eyes shine. It shows a hologram: [T.O.B.I. UNIT-2 / JUMP]. Jump races into a dark tunnel. Miso’s heart pounds, but she follows. The elevator creaks down: 80 meters, 180 meters, 400 meters. At the bottom, damp air surrounds her. Rusty walls, old tools, and dripping water are everywhere. The smell of coal dust and oil fills the air. Jump taps a device, and a panel opens. Robo wakes up. “T.O.B.I. UNIT-1: ROBO. Offline: 3,672 days,” it says in a warm, metallic voice. “Mine status: stable. Groundwater: 9.8°C, 5,000 tons daily. Cooling efficiency: 92.4%.” Miso freezes. “A data center?” Robo nods. “Yes. It can cool machines and heat the village. Other countries use this system.” Miso grips the papers. “Did my dad build this?”

The ground shakes. Robo’s eyes flash red. “Warning: unknown signal detected.” Jump climbs the wall, scanning the dark. “Something’s there—not human,” it signals. Robo stares into a corner. “Unknown system… or Ian?” Miso’s pulse races. A chill runs down her spine. “This isn’t just a mine…” She faces Robo and Jump, her voice firm. “We’ll wake this village. It starts now.” The river’s rhythm above matches her heartbeat.

## 📖 Reading: Story (B2 English Version)

**Light Lives Beneath the Village**

In Taebaek’s winter of 2025, Miso lingered before the forsaken Jangseong Elementary School, clutching her father’s corroded metal box. The Hwangjeecheon River’s gentle murmur drifted nearby, while a biting breeze grazed her cheeks. Kneeling, she pried open the lid, unveiling faded manuscripts titled “T.O.B.I. Project: Jangseong Mine Heat Recovery System.” Her father’s calligraphy, both unfamiliar and achingly familiar, stirred her. “What were you dreaming of?” she murmured, as if the papers might respond.

Intrigued, Miso approached the derelict mine, its gate marked with a crumbling “No Entry” sign. She shoved it open, and a chill, alien air rushed out. Abruptly, a nimble robot, Jump, leaped onto a metal surface, its azure eyes gleaming. It tilted its head, blinked twice, and projected a hologram: [T.O.B.I. UNIT-2 / JUMP]. Without pause, it darted toward an underground passage. Miso hesitated, then followed, her pulse racing.

The lift creaked downward: 80m, 180m, 400m. At 400 meters, damp air enveloped her. Peeling iron walls, mining relics, and dripping water surrounded her. Miso inhaled the musty blend of coal dust and oil. Jump sprang to a wall, activating a cube-like device. With a hum, a panel slid open, and Robo stirred. “T.O.B.I. UNIT-1: ROBO. Standby: 3,672 days,” it intoned, its metallic voice tinged with warmth. “Mine conditions optimal. Groundwater: 9.8°C, 5,000 tons daily. Cooling efficiency 92.4%.” Miso’s breath caught. “A data center?” Robo affirmed, “Correct. Estonia, Finland, Norway precedents validate feasibility. Village heating efficiency 86%.” Jump shifted pipes nearby, clearing space. Miso recalled her father’s script. “Did he create this?”

A tremor jolted the ground. Robo’s eyes flickered rapidly. “Warning: unidentified signal detected. T.O.B.I. protocol violation.” Jump scaled the walls, its gaze piercing the darkness. “Something’s there—not human,” it signaled. Robo’s eyes froze blue. “Unknown system… or Ian?” Miso’s heart pounded, a shiver coursing through her. “This isn’t merely a mine…” She faced Robo and Jump, her resolve unwavering. “We’ll awaken this village. It starts here.” Above, the river’s cadence pulsed like a heartbeat, echoing her vow.
